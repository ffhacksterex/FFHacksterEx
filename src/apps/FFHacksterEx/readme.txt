FFHacksterEx

Setup

The App

    Go to the Releases page.
    Download the app zip package (x86 or x64)
    Create a folder for FFHEx, then unzip the package contents into that folder.
    NOTE: ensure that the folder you create is in a writable folder.

Local Help
If you want help documentation, then do the following:

    - Go to the Releases page.
    - Download the help zip package.
    - Unzip the help package into the FFHEx folder you created above for the app.

Here's an example:

    - Download the app and help zip files.
    - Create a folder, then extract the contents of the app zip into it.
    In this case, 7-zip can do it in one step with the Extract to <foldername> command.
    For this example, the folder is now named ffhacksterex-0.9.7-win64-x64-v140_xp
    - Extract the contents of the help zip file into the ffhacksterex-0.9.7-win64-x64-v140_xp folder
    The app folder should now contain a help subfolder.
    - Go into the folder, then run FFHacksterEx.exe.
    - The "Welcome to FFHackster EX" dialog appears. press F1.
    - Hopefully, a browser window opens to the Main document in question.
    This typically opens a new tab in the default browser.
    NOTE: currently, each help page will be invoked in a separate tab.
