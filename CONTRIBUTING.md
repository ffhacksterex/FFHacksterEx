This code is posted for reference purposes. \
It is intended to make the code available for anyone interested to fork to a new project.

It is not intended for community contrribution.

**No pull requests will be reviewed or merged for the project.** \
Bug reports submitted **will likely not be handled.** \
It's possible that the project could significantly change,
or even be archived as read-only in the future.

I suggest using this code for reference and starting
a new project with newer tools,
as MFC is a Windows-only desktop library that has been closed
for feature updates since at least 2010.
